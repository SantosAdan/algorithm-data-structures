# Classic Algorithms and Data Structures
> I'm going to revisit every Data Structure and Classic Algorithms I've learned in the past and implement them in Apex. I'll also try to add some comments to explain the code and the logic behind it.

## Data Structures

- [ ] 2. Linked List
- [ ] 3. Stack
- [ ] 4. Queue
- [ ] 5. Hash Table
- [ ] 6. Heap
- [ ] 7. Graph

## Algorithms
- [ ] 1. Binary Search Tree (BST)
- [ ] 2. Quicksort
- [ ] 3. Mergesort
- [ ] 4. Breadth First Search (BFS)
- [ ] 5. Depth First Search (DFS)
- [ ] 6. Dijkstra's Algorithm.
